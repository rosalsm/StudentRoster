# The Iron Yard -- Durham Student Roster

It's not just a directory of trivia, it's also a practice problem!

## To play this game...

1. Fork this project.
2. Add a file for yourself...
  * copy the contents of `TEMPLATE.md` into a file named `USERNAME.md` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username
  * add and commit that file into your forked repo
3. [Open a Pull Request (PR](https://github.com/TIY-Durham/StudentRoster/pulls) from your fork to `master`
4. Get your PR merged...
  * maybe @-mention your instructor in the description?
  * drop a link to the PR in yor chat room?
  * compose an interpretive dance to perform at standup?

## Congrats! Now what?

Your instructor will give you weekly assignments to fill out the information for your cohort based on the `TEMPLATE.md` file. You'll need to `git pull` regularly in a local clone to get the latest commits from your fellow students, and open additional PRs to add your own. Over time, we'll `git` to know one another... :tomato:
